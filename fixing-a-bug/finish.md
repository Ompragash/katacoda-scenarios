## Finished

We hope you found this useful.

As with Ansible, this course is open source.

As this is something new, we really need *your* feedback, join the [discussion](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/discussions/119)

Found a bug, the source can be found at [ansible-community/katacoda-scenarios](https://github.com/ansible-community/katacoda-scenarios)
